# Neural Network

### CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)
    Technologies used:
    Python - Programming language
    Pytorch - open-source machine learning framework primarily used for building and training deep learning models. 
        It provides a robust set of tools and functionalities for various tasks within the field of artificial intelligence
    NumPy -  a powerful open-source library in Python primarily used for scientific computing and numerical operations. 
        Linear Algebra for example
    TensorFlow - an open-source software library primarily used for machine learning and deep learning. 
        It provides tools and resources for building and deploying machine learning models, especially neural networks, across various platforms and devices
    Keras - a high-level API (Application Programming Interface) for building and training neural networks
